This contract can only be used by me (smarx). I don’t trust myself to remember my private key, so I’ve made it so whatever address I’m using in the future will work:

I always use a wallet contract that returns “smarx” if you ask its name.
Everything I write has bad code in it, so my address always includes the hex string badc0de.
To complete this challenge, steal my identity!
