I created a token bank. It allows anyone to deposit tokens by transferring them to the bank and then to withdraw those tokens later. It uses [ERC 223](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223) to accept the incoming tokens.

The bank deploys a token called “Simple ERC223 Token” and assigns half the tokens to me and half to you. You win this challenge if you can empty the bank.
